# 2025_CRN_CM_Workshop
Notebooks and docs for the 2025 ASAP CRN Collaborative Meeting Cloud Training Workshop

## Overview
This collection of notebooks demonstrates how to use the Verily Workbench JupyterLab apps to explore and analyze ASAP CRN Cloud data.   The the harmonized cohort of PMDBS scRNAseq datasets will be used to illustrate the example.   


## Notebooks
For this workshop Parts 1 & 2 will be presented quickly by scrolling the executed notebooks, and the workshop _task_ consists of Part 3:  A simple "Gene Of Interest" exploration detailed in [03_GOI_analysis.ipynb](./notebooks/03_GOI_analysis.ipynb).   The final part 4 is for completeness and left mostly as a take-home exercise to illustrate a more full-fledged meta-analysis on the ASAP CRN Cloud datasets.


### Setup
A notebook suitable for executing on the Verily Workbench JupyterLab App copies the data resources nescessary to execute the workshop materials efficiently.  Once this [workshop_setup.ipynb](./notebooks/workshop_setup.ipynb) is executed, a local machine copy of the rest of the notebooks will be available. While the overall end-to-end notebook and the complete cycle demonstrate and can make all of these data files, the time and resources required to execute are not suitable for this workshop.


### cycle
- Open this notebook in the workspace and execute. [00_full_example_notebook.ipynb](./notebooks/00_full_example_notebook.ipynb)
